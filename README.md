# Husk

Husk was created as a project during a my time at University in collaboration with Ivo, Tom, Adam, Em, Jaz. This is a turn-based card combat game and puzzle game. My personal work on this project mostly consisted of the card combat system. Anything to do with the card combat I created, not including any of the art and animations, I only implemented the animation into the system.
